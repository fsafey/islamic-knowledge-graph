### Core Simulation Setup
```javascript
simulation = d3.forceSimulation(graphData.nodes)
    // ... force configuration ...
    .alphaDecay(0.005)     // Optimized: Slower decay
    .velocityDecay(0.4)    // Base velocity, dynamically adjusted
    .alphaTarget(0.01);    // Organic movement baseline
```

### Enhanced Drag Implementation
```javascript
// Momentum-based dragging with visual feedback
function dragged(event, d) {
    const dampening = 0.8;
    d.fx = d.fx * (1 - dampening) + event.x * dampening;
    d.fy = d.fy * (1 - dampening) + event.y * dampening;
    // ... energy boosting and feedback ...
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Real-time simulation state tracking
console.log(`üìä Enhanced Graph Stats: ${interactionCount} interactions, 
    Alpha: ${simAlpha}, VelocityDecay: ${simVelocityDecay}`);
